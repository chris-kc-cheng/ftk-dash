# Financial Toolkit in Dash

Plotly Dash is a framework

This is an evolution of the ftk-streamlit project. While Streamlit is great in speed of development of basic dashboard, Dash is more powerful for more complex one. In this project, I am trying to build an interactive market monitoring dashboard across asset classes using free data sources.
